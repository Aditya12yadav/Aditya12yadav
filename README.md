✨During my academic journey, I actively seek internships and projects to enhance my skills. Recently, I completed a Software Engineering Virtual Experience program with Goldman Sachs, gaining hands-on experience in password cracking and improving security using Hashcat. I also successfully completed an Amazon Web Services virtual internship provided by AICTE, refining my cloud computing abilities.

🌟Currently, I'm engaged in a Martian Internship with Persistent Systems, contributing to cutting-edge technologies.

🌟As a proactive learner, I've developed projects showcasing my technical expertise, like a Voice Classification system using MFCC features and SVM-based classification for accurate speaker identification. Additionally, I created a PowerPoint Presentation Control App with integrated speech recognition for easy navigation.

🌟In deep learning, I crafted a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model with LSTM and attention mechanisms for precise German-English translation. I was also part of the winning team for "Bugmed," a mobile app providing healthcare facilities to rural areas, in the Codeheist NSS Hackathon.

⭐Beyond technical skills, I possess strong soft skills such as leadership, public speaking, and effective teamwork, thriving in collaborative environments.

⚽Outside academics, I enjoy football to maintain a healthy work-life balance.
